In post:
. required: true
The required field under requestBody specifies whether the request body is mandatory for the operation. Setting this to true ensures that the API understands the request body is essential for the post operation.

2. content field under requestBody
The content field defines the media type (e.g., application/json) and the schema that describes the structure of the request body. This is crucial for API clients and documentation tools to understand what format the request body should be in and how it should be structured. Without this, the API specification is incomplete, and clients wonâ€™t know how to format their requests.

3. components/schemas section
Defining schemas under the components/schemas section allows you to reuse these schemas across multiple endpoints and operations. It also makes the API specification cleaner and more maintainable. The Product schema describes the structure of the product data that the API expects and returns, ensuring consistent data formats.

Example Explanation:
Without required: true:
The API client might assume that the request body is optional and might omit it, causing errors during execution.

Without content:
The API documentation would not specify the expected format of the request body, leading to confusion for developers using the API.

Without components/schemas:
The request body structure would have to be defined inline for every endpoint, leading to duplication and harder maintenance.
